# Diabetes classification

Data exploration and machine learning classification on the Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set from UCI.

## Problem
The Pima indians (Akimel O?odham) of Arizona have the highest rate of diabetes of any population in the world. Hence we should be able by analysing data and using machine learning make predictive indications on how likely a person is to get diabetes.

## The data
The Pima Indian diabetes database, donated by Vincent Sigillito, is a collection of medical diagnostic reports. The dataset is publicly available both at UCI <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes>and Kaggle <https: //www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database>.
